## Code for Learning OpenCV

As much as possible, the code in this repository should be OpenCV specific without requiring the assistance of models and conveniences. As much as possible, the code should use just what OpenCV offers. The intention of this repos is to learn about the capabilities of just OpenCV so that when it comes time to start designing the alpha product, we have a reasonable knowledge base to build upon.

## Recommendations
* Take the free course on OpenCV available at https://opencv.org/university/free-opencv-course/ so you have a baseline understanding of OpenCV. It's free for registering with OpenCV.

## Goals
* Learn what OpenCV can do by itself
* Learn where OpenCV needs help or extensions
* Learn any best practices on using OpenCV so we will know the best way to extend its capabilities
